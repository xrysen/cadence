Act 1 – Arrival in Cantible & Discovery
1. First Steps in Cantible
Cadence arrives in Cantible, a faded, once-vibrant port town that feels half-asleep under the quiet rule of the Order of Silence.

Music is outlawed. Street performers are gone, instruments are contraband, and people speak in hushed tones.

She explores the town, absorbing its eerie calm and strange reverence toward “peace.”

Locals are suspicious of newcomers and tight-lipped about the Institute or anything related to “the Song.”

🎭 CANTIBLE NPCs & DIALOGUE
🧓 Old Luthier (Instrument repair shop – shuttered)
A retired craftsman who once made instruments for the Institute.

He speaks in riddles and avoids direct answers.

Luthier:
“Strings break. Wood warps. Voices fade. But some things… still resonate.”

[When asked about Allegro]
“A man who chased the impossible harmony. Broke more than just chords tryin’.”

🧕 Shopkeeper Nola (General goods vendor)
Nervous and polite. Has a child who hums forbidden tunes.

Nola:
“Mind your voice, traveler. There are ears even in silence.”

[Optional: Player hears her daughter quietly humming.]
“Stop that! You know what happened to the minstrel boy!”

[Later, if trust is built]
“They took him away in the night. Said his melody ‘fractured the stillness.’ All he wanted was to make people smile.”

🧙‍♂️ Street Bard, “No Strings” (Mouth harp player – doesn’t sing)
A mysterious traveler who performs without voice or lyrics.

Seems to recognize Cadence.

Bard:
“Your steps beat strange rhythms. Old ones.”
“I knew another with music in his bones. Wrote the sky a lullaby. The stars didn’t sleep.”

[When pressed]
“The Institute tried to teach harmony. But forgot what a melody truly is.”

🧑‍🏫 Archivist Thae (Quiet scholar in ruined Institute annex)
One of the few who still studies pre-ban music theory.

Helps Cadence find records of Allegro.

Thae:
“Most of the scores were burned. But fragments remain… dissonant, unfinished. Like his final work.”

“He believed song could change the gods, not just praise them. Heresy, they called it.”

“If you are his daughter, then the Song lives still.”

👩‍✈️ Guard Captain Sera (Stationed near teleport gate)
Wary of magic and resistant to rebellion.

Can give useful clues if respected or manipulated.

Sera:
“We keep the peace here. That includes the silence.”

[If player gains her trust]
“Stretto? He was a war hero once. Before he started preaching about ‘unbound resonance.’ Haven’t seen him in years.”

👴 Fisherman Hale (Harbor)
Spends his days mending nets and humming old sea shanties under his breath.

Hale:
“Bah, the Order can stuff cotton in their ears. The sea don’t care who sings to it.”

“Used to hear music on the wind. Real music. Then the gods went quiet. Then the people did too.”

🧒 Child NPC (optional)
Hides in alleyways, trying to mimic melodies heard in dreams.

Child:
“Do you hear it too? The song in the air? Mama says it’s ghosts, but I think it’s… calling me.”

🧑‍🌾 NPC: Widow Arlyn (Elderly woman tending to a rooftop garden in Cantible)
Survived The Silence and speaks about it in hushed, haunted tones.

Seen as slightly eccentric, but respected for her age and memory.

Her garden only grows sound-reactive flora — a nod to the past.

🌿 First Encounter:
Arlyn (to herself, softly humming):
“No no no… not that chord. That one hurts the roots…”

Cadence:
“Excuse me… what are you singing?”

Arlyn: (startled)
“Oh! Forgive me. I forget myself sometimes. You’d think after the Silence, we’d all stop humming. But songs are like weeds — they grow in cracks.”

🌿 Ask About The Silence:
Cadence:
“You mentioned the Silence… What was it?”

Arlyn:
“A single note. That’s all it took. One note sung wrong… or maybe right. No one agrees.”

“Some say it was Allegro. Others say it was the gods themselves, punishing us for singing too freely. The sky cracked. Instruments shattered. And for a moment… the world held its breath.”

[She pauses, presses her fingers to her ears.]
“It never quite let it go.”

🌿 Optional Follow-up (after temple progress or music box memory):
Arlyn:
“They called it a catastrophe. I call it a beginning. Harmony fears change. Dissonance invites it. That note—whatever it was—meant something. And maybe, just maybe, you’re the rest of the song.”

2. Meeting Poco
Cadence hears faint chimes and follows them to a boy tending to injured birds with little silver bells—Poco.

They bond. Poco feels strangely drawn to her music box, which begins to emit a soft glow.

He offers to help her find Stretto, someone his grandmother once knew.

3. The Hidden Institute
With Poco’s help, Cadence uncovers a hidden entrance to the abandoned Institute—a once-sacred academy of the Art of Song now sealed by the Order.

Inside, they discover signs of a hasty evacuation. There are strange echoes, ghostly music fragments, and journal entries left by Allegro and Stretto.

A spectral memory shows Allegro warning Stretto about Harmony’s intentions and speaking of the coming "Resonant Cataclysm."

4. Stretto Revealed
Stretto has been hiding beneath the old bell tower, using its resonance to shield himself from detection.

Grumpy but deeply knowledgeable, he reluctantly agrees to help Cadence. He reveals:

Her father tried to restore balance by reuniting Harmony and Dissonance.

The gods vanished after a divine discord, and their temples are now cut off from the world.

The only way to restore them—or stop what's coming—is to awaken each god’s domain.

5. Unlocking the First Temple
Cadence’s music box resonates with a seal at the town square, triggering an ancient teleport gate: the first path to Tempo’s Temple opens.

Stretto warns: “Only the First Voice could navigate these realms. And you… you might be its echo.”
