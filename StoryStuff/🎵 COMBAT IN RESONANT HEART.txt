🎵 COMBAT IN RESONANT HEART
🔸 Combat Style: Rhythm-Infused Turn-Based (or ATB-lite)
Core idea: Every party member’s abilities are tied to musical patterns—tempo, rhythm, harmony, and dissonance.

Input system: Each character's actions have short rhythm inputs (like hitting a few notes in time) to execute enhanced versions of spells/attacks. Think simplified rhythm minigame per action.

Duet Combos: Characters can "sync" for special attacks—these require both characters' rhythms to match or complement each other.

⚔️ TYPES OF ENEMIES
We can group enemies into 3 main categories:

🧍 1. Silenced Ones (Humanoid)
Victims of the Silence. They’ve lost their voices, or their minds fractured when they resisted Harmony’s doctrine.

Hollow Chorister: Sings dissonant, ghostly tones that debuff your rhythm meter.

Tonewarden: Harmony's soldiers—use order and repetition to lock your actions.

Muted Acolyte: Moves slowly, but silences a character if not interrupted.

🗨️ “They’re not evil… they just forgot how to listen.”

🪨 2. Resonant Beasts (Elemental/Magical Creatures)
Creatures warped by imbalanced resonance—some corrupted, others confused.

Crackling Timebeast (Tempo): Shifts initiative order, speeds up enemy turns.

Weeping Bloom (Melody): Grows stronger if not interrupted emotionally.

Harmony Golem: Attacks in repeating patterns. Must be desynchronized.

Dissonant Wisp: Unpredictable attacks, changes weakness mid-battle.

👁️ 3. Echoes & Shadows (Memory & Divine-Themed)
These appear in temples or music-box flashbacks.

Echo of Allegro: A boss-level mirror that uses combinations of your own party’s moves.

Fragmented Harmony: Appears as a radiant being—but attacks if you sing out of "order".

The Screaming Silence (late game): Boss whose scream disrupts rhythm, must be beaten with coordinated duets.

💥 BATTLE THEMES
Combat should evolve musically too.

Enemies could have themes in different time signatures (e.g., 3/4 vs 4/4) that challenge your inputs.

Bosses shift the rhythm mid-fight—forcing you to adapt.

For example, a Harmony boss may start with strict 4/4 patterns (easy to follow), but becomes erratic when breaking apart, revealing Dissonance.

🧪 STATUS EFFECTS WITH A MUSICAL TWIST
Status Effect	Description
Silenced	Can’t use song-based magic
Offbeat	Rhythm input windows are harder to hit
Echoed	Attack repeats uncontrollably next turn
Muted Memory	Temporary memory loss of spell patterns
Synchronized	Temporary boost with a specific ally

📊 ENCOUNTER DESIGN
Random Battles? Nope. Have enemies visible in the world—sometimes as shifting sound shapes or lingering echoes.

Battle Zones: Certain areas “hum” or shimmer, alerting you that the resonance there is unstable and may attract enemies.

Cantible: Mostly safe—until late-game shifts begin. Optional side dungeons in town can reveal corrupted music spirits.
