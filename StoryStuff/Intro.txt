🎬 INTRO CUTSCENE: “The Last Note”
Scene Length: 2–3 minutes (non-playable cinematic)
Location: Cadence’s Home, Edge of the Quiet Village
📽️ FADE IN:
Muted wind over barren hills. Birds do not sing. Just a soft, droning tone—the low hum of a world holding its breath.

Exterior shot: A modest house at the edge of a quiet village. One window glows faintly with candlelight.

📍 Interior – Cadence’s Home
Camera pans slowly: dusty shelves, faded sheet music pinned to the wall, and a piano covered in cloth.

Cadence (17, quiet resolve, eyes that carry too much memory) stands before the piano. She gently lifts the cloth.

She presses a key.
[Soft key press — no sound.]

Cadence (whispers):
“Still silent…”

She runs her fingers along the keys. One flickers faintly with light, then fades.

Door creaks open behind her. Her mother (mid-40s, worn but graceful) enters, holding a small, ornate music box.

🎙️ DIALOGUE:
Mother:
(softly)
“You shouldn’t be playing with that. If the Order finds out—”

Cadence: (without turning)
“I heard something. In my dream. A song.”

Mother: (hesitates)
“Dreams are dangerous, Cadence. So is music.”

Cadence: (finally turns to her)
“Then why did you keep this?”

Mother looks down at the music box. A long pause.

Mother:
“Because… some songs never leave you. No matter how far you try to run.”

She gently places the box on the piano.

Mother (cont’d):
“It’s time you heard the rest of it.”

Cadence opens the music box. Instead of playing, it glows faintly. A haunting, broken melody drifts out—out of tune but powerful. The room darkens. Shadows coil on the walls.

🎥 VISION SEQUENCE (INSIDE THE BOX)
Quick, emotional flashes:

A crumbling temple, vines overtaking stone.

A man in shadow (Allegro) turning toward the camera—his face half-hidden.

Three statues: Tempo (massive and grounded), Melody (flowing, floral), Harmony (angelic, stern).

A fourth figure—fractured, torn in two. One side radiant, the other jagged and dark.

The statues begin to crack.

A blast of soundless light. A scream—but there is no sound.

📍 CUT BACK TO: INT. HOME – NIGHT
Cadence stumbles backward, breathing hard. The box has closed on its own.

Cadence:
(shaken)
“That was… Father…”

Her mother is already walking away, her expression unreadable.

Mother: (soft, final)
“Pack what you need. Go to Cantible. Find Stretto. He knew your father. And he… he knows the truth of the Song.”

📽️ DISSOLVE TO: NEXT MORNING
The house is empty. Only a folded letter and the music box remain.

Narration (Cadence’s inner voice, reading the letter):
“I’m sorry I couldn’t go with you. But you must understand… they silenced the world for a reason. Now it’s time for you to find out why.”

📍 EXT. DOCK – MORNING
Cadence boards a small merchant vessel. She clutches her satchel and the box. As the ship sails away, she looks back one last time.

Fog gathers on the sea. The sails flap in near silence. A woman with a bright red coat and a rapier slung to her back (Tina) leans on the railing.

Tina:
(teasing, curious)
“First time sailing alone?”

Cadence:
“First time… going anywhere.”

Tina: (grins)
“Then you picked a hell of a time to chase ghosts, songbird. Storms are brewin’.”

As the ship moves forward, faint whispers of music thread through the fog—only Cadence seems to hear them. Her eyes widen.

📽️ TITLE CARD FADES IN:
Resonant Heart
"To restore the world, she must sing the truth no one wants to hear."

🎼 [Theme swells in a soft minor key, then cuts to silence.]

Would you like the next scene on the ship with Tina as an interactive moment, or skip to Cadence arriving in Cantible with light exploration/tutorial mechanics and dialogue?
