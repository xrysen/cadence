Cadence

This is a story, well idea for a story, I've had in my head for quite some time. I haven't built anything in a modern game engine as I used to just make games in an extremely outdated engine that hasn't been updated in literally 20 years.

So I thought it was time I get back into it.

Godot seems to be the most recommended for what I want to accomplish, so this is my attempt at building an RPG engine with it and show a short story.

The goal of "Cadence" is to be a short, musical inspired, RPG.
